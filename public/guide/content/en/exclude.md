If you have accounts that need to be tracked but should not be counted towards your personal total assets (e.g., funds managed for others, company money, or temporary transit accounts), Synx provides a feature to exclude them from your statistics.

## 2. The Effects

Once this feature is enabled, the system will stop including this account in your overall financial data. The specific effects are:

* **Group Total Exclusion:** The balance of this account will be deducted from the "Account Group" totals.
* **Chart Exclusion:** Data from this account will not appear in the "Net Worth Line Chart" or asset allocation diagrams.

## 💡 Use Case

This feature ensures that your net worth trend and asset overview reflect only **"wealth that truly belongs to you,"** preventing managed funds or temporary capital from distorting your financial picture.
