Synx offers the same powerful core features across both Free and Pro versions. Whether you are tracking assets, managing investments, or recording cash flow, the fundamental tools are available to everyone.

## The Difference: Usage Limits

The distinction lies primarily in usage capacity rather than feature availability.

* **Free Plan:**
    To maintain service stability while covering the costs of paid real-time market data APIs, the Free plan has limits on:
    * The number of **Investment Accounts** you can create.
    * The frequency of **Daily Market Price Updates**.

* **Synx Pro:**
    Upgrading to Pro removes these barriers. You unlock **unlimited investment accounts** and **higher frequency updates**, allowing you to manage a larger portfolio with the most up-to-date data.
