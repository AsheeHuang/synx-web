## 1. How to Sort

1.  Go to the **Insight** page.
2.  **Long press** the account card you want to move.
3.  Once the card "lifts up," **drag** it to your desired position.
4.  Release your finger to drop it in place.

## 2. Tips for Organization

* **Pin Favorites to Top:** We recommend moving your most active accounts (like your "Cash Wallet" or "Primary Credit Card") to the top of the list for quicker daily logging.
* **Visual Grouping:** You can manually arrange similar accounts together (e.g., placing all bank accounts side-by-side). Even if they belong to different logical groups, this keeps your visual layout organized and easy to scan.
