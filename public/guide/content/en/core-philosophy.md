Synx is a comprehensive asset management and net worth tracking tool designed to help you bid farewell to complex spreadsheets and reclaim control over your scattered financial life.

## The Problem of Fragmentation

In the digital age, your wealth is often fragmented across multiple platforms: savings in bank accounts, stocks in brokerage apps, crypto in cold wallets, and liabilities on credit card statements.

Answering the simple question, **"What is my current net worth?"** is surprisingly difficult. It typically involves logging into multiple platforms and manually calculating the total—a process that is time-consuming and rarely up-to-date. Without seeing the true figure of "Total Assets minus Total Liabilities," making precise long-term financial decisions becomes a guessing game.

## The Meaning of "Synx"

The name **Synx** embodies our mission to keep your financial reality in perfect synchronization. It operates on two levels:

1.  **Market Sync:** We synchronize real-time stock prices, exchange rates, and crypto values from global markets.
2.  **Cash Flow Sync:** We automate the tracking of your recurring income, expenses, and investments.

By combining these elements into a single interface, Synx ensures that your **Dashboard** is always **"In Sync"** with your **Real Life**. Whether you hold cash, debts, stocks, or precious metals, Synx transforms raw data into a clear visual journey, helping you track every step toward financial freedom.
