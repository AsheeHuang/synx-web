You may notice a slight discrepancy between the stock prices shown in Synx and the real-time quotes in your brokerage app. This is normal behavior. Here is an explanation of the underlying mechanisms.

## 1. Why is there a delay?

### API Data Limitations
Synx utilizes third-party financial data APIs that provide **"Delayed Quotes,"** typically with a **15 to 30-minute time lag**. This is the industry standard for portfolio management tools (unless a premium is paid for direct exchange licensing).

### Caching Mechanism
To optimize app performance and manage server load, Synx implements a short-term caching mechanism. This ensures the app runs smoothly without making excessive data requests every second.

## 2. How does this affect you?

### For Long-Term Investors: Minimal Impact
Synx is designed for **Net Worth Tracking** and **Asset Allocation**, not for high-frequency trading. A 15 to 30-minute delay does not affect the accuracy of your long-term trend analysis or overall financial health check.

### For Active Traders: Please Note
If you are a day trader or require split-second precision, we recommend relying on your brokerage's trading terminal for execution. Synx is best used for **post-trade bookkeeping** and **performance review**.

## 💡 Summary

The core philosophy of Synx is **"Long-term Asset Management,"** not "Real-time Trading." The slightly delayed data is sufficient for you to maintain a clear and accurate grasp of your overall financial status.
