Occasionally, you may notice a discrepancy between the balance in Synx and your actual bank account. Instead of manually calculating the difference and creating a separate "Income" or "Expense" transaction to fix it, Synx offers a quick shortcut for **non-investment accounts**.

This feature allows you to simply overwrite the current balance, and the system will handle the rest.

## How to Adjust

1.  **Select Account:** From the **Insight** page, tap on the account you wish to correct to enter its detail view.
2.  **Enter Edit Mode:** Tap the **Edit** button in the top right corner.
3.  **Update Balance:** Directly modify the number in the **Balance** field to match your actual current funds.
4.  **Auto-Correction:** Tap **Save**. The system will automatically calculate the difference and generate a specific **"Balance Adjustment"** transaction record to reconcile your accounts instantly.
