When an account is no longer in use, you can choose to remove it permanently or save its history for reference.

## Steps

1.  Go to the **Insight** page.
2.  Tap on the specific account to open its details page.
3.  Tap the **Delete** button (trash can icon) in the bottom left corner.
4.  A menu will appear asking you to choose between **Delete** or **Archive**.

## Delete vs. Archive: What's the Difference?

### Delete
Permanently removes the account.
* **Result:** The account and **all associated transaction history** will be wiped completely.
* **Undo:** This action **cannot** be undone.

### Archive
Sets the account to "Inactive" status.
* **Result:** The account will be hidden from your daily lists to reduce clutter, but **your complete transaction history is preserved** for future reference.

## ⚠️ Requirements for Archiving

To ensure your financial reports and net worth calculations remain logically accurate, you must meet the following conditions before archiving:

* **Non-Investment Accounts:** The account balance must be **0**.
* **Investment Accounts:** The number of shares or units held must be **0**.

> **💡 Suggestion:** If the account still has funds, please add a "Transfer" (to move money elsewhere) or an "Expense" transaction to zero it out before archiving.
>
> *Note: Once archived, the account is hidden by default. You can view archived accounts by adjusting the display options on the Insight page.*
