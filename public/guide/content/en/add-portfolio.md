Once you manage multiple accounts, the **Portfolio Page** becomes your analytical hub. While Synx provides default views (such as "All Assets" or market-based lists), you can create custom portfolios to analyze your wealth from different angles.

## Creating a Custom Portfolio

If you want to group specific assets together (e.g., a "Retirement Fund" or "US Stocks Watchlist"), follow these steps:

1.  Tap the **"+"** button and select **"New Portfolio"**.
2.  The system will list all your existing accounts (including both investment and non-investment accounts). **Check the boxes** for the accounts you want to include in this group.
3.  Give this portfolio a **Name**.

## Advanced Group Management

After creating a portfolio, you will enter the **"Edit Group"** screen. This is one of Synx's most powerful classification features:

* **Default Groups:** The system initially applies the original groups you set when you created the accounts.
* **Custom Groups:** You can create entirely new categorization logic specifically for *this* portfolio without affecting how these accounts appear on other pages.
* **Use Cases:** Try regrouping your assets by **Risk Level** (High/Low Risk), **Sector** (Tech/Finance), or even **Strategy** (ETF vs. Individual Stock) to get deeper insights.

## Switching Views

Once set up, return to the Portfolio Page. Tap the **Menu icon** in the top-left corner to freely switch between the default view and your **Custom Portfolios**. This allows you to inspect your wealth from multiple dimensions instantly.
