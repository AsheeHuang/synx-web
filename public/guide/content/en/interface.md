All core functions are accessible through the bottom navigation bar. From left to right, here is your guide to Synx's interface:

## 1. Portfolio Page
**Your Investment Command Center.**

* **Function:** View your asset allocation pie charts, along with real-time prices and Profit & Loss (P&L) performance for individual holdings (stocks, crypto, etc.).
* **Best For:** When you want to answer, "What do I own right now?" or "How much has this specific stock earned?"

## 2. Insight Page
**Your Financial Health Check.**
This is the default home screen when you launch Synx, showing your balances and historical trends.

* **Function:** Displays your "Total Net Worth," compares total Assets vs. Liabilities, and visualizes your wealth trend over time.
* **Best For:** Quickly grasping your overall financial health and ensuring your assets are on the right growth track.

## 3. Transactions Page
**Your Cash Flow Hub.**
This is where you manage cash flow and review history.

* **Function:** Lists all historical records (expenses, income, trades) and highlights "Upcoming" pending items (such as credit card bills or DCA deductions).

## 4. The "+" Button
**Your Primary Action Key.**
The teal button in the bottom right corner is the most important tool in Synx. It adapts dynamically based on your status:
