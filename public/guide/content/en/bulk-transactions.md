When you have accumulated multiple pending investment transactions (such as several months of DCA records), confirming them one by one can be time-consuming. Synx offers a powerful **Batch Processing** feature to help you clear the backlog efficiently.

## 1. Entering Batch Mode

In the transaction list, if the system detects multiple pending transactions for the same asset, you can initiate **Batch Processing** to handle them all at once.

## 2. Select Calculation Method

The system will list all your unfinished transactions. Depending on your investment style, you can choose one of the two rapid entry methods:

### Fixed Amount Method
**Best For:** Investors who invest a fixed sum each time (e.g., deducting $10,000 monthly).

* **Logic:** You only need to enter the **Total Amount**. The system automatically fetches the historical **"Closing Price"** for each date and reverse-calculates how many shares you purchased.

### Fixed Shares Method
**Best For:** Investors who buy a specific quantity of shares each time (e.g., buying 10 shares monthly).

* **Logic:** You only need to enter the **Number of Shares**. The system multiplies the shares by the historical **"Closing Price"** for each date to automatically calculate the total cost.

### 💡 Smart Tip
The system uses the market **Closing Price** by default, which may differ slightly from your actual execution price. We recommend doing a quick review and fine-tuning the numbers after the auto-calculation to ensure your records are 100% accurate.
