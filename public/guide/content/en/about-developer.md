## Why Synx?

I am a software engineer with five years of experience in the industry. Currently, I am taking a Gap Year to dedicate myself full-time to developing this product—born out of a desire to solve my own financial management pain points.

In my search for the ideal asset management tool, I could never find one that fit perfectly:

* **Lack of Integration:** Most apps only track stocks but fail to manage cash, real estate, and bank accounts simultaneously, making it impossible to see the "full picture."
* **The DCA Blind Spot:** Existing tools struggle to accurately record Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA), often leading to incorrect cost basis calculations and lacking necessary reminders.
* **The Automation Dilemma:** Fully automated apps that link to banks often raise security and privacy concerns; conversely, fully manual spreadsheets feel like tedious labor.

## The Philosophy: The Perfect Balance

I built Synx to fill that void of "Simple yet Complete." It is a **Semi-Automated System**:

* **Auto:** It automatically syncs global stock prices and exchange rates, calculating your P&L in real-time.
* **Manual:** It puts you in control of recording cash flow, with the system providing smart nudges only when needed.

I don't believe in tracking every single penny of daily spending. Instead, Synx focuses on **Asset Trends** and the **Big Picture**. You don't need to hand over your bank passwords, nor do you need to perform complex operations. It is designed to be Clean, Clear, and Reliable.

Synx was born to solve my problems, and I am happy to say it has. I hope it becomes a trusted partner on your financial journey as well.
