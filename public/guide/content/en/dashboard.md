## 2. Historical Analysis & Charts

Beyond current numbers, this is where you review your investment journey:

* **Historical Holdings:** View a complete log of all past buy/sell transactions and how your share count has changed over time.
* **Trend Charts:** Use interactive charts to visualize cost changes, market price trends, and the trajectory of your average cost. This helps you evaluate the timing and quality of your entry and exit points.
