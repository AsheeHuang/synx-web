Synx does more than just record assets; it helps you organize them. With the flexible **"Groups"** feature, you can classify and view your finances based on your own logic—whether by asset type, usage, or risk profile.

This chapter explains how to set up and apply groups effectively.

## 1. Setting Up Groups

Group settings are integrated directly into the account creation workflow. While the system provides smart defaults, you retain full control to customize them.

### Initial Setup

When creating a new account, the system guides you through categorization:

* **Non-Investment Accounts:**
    The system asks you to select a default group, such as "Cash" or "Bank." This helps distinguish liquid assets from other types.
* **Investment Accounts:**
    The system automatically groups these based on **Region/Market** (e.g., US Stocks, TW Stocks, Crypto), saving you the hassle of manual classification.

### Customization

If the default classification doesn't fit your needs (e.g., you want to reclassify a specific bank account as a "Retirement Fund"):

1.  Go to the **Account Details** page of that specific account.
2.  Tap on the **Group** field to edit.
3.  You can select an existing group or type a new name to create a brand-new group instantly.

## 2. Display & Overview

The real power of groups lies in how they change your perspective on your wealth.

* **Switching Views:** On the **Insight** page, you can access the display settings and switch your view mode to **"By Group."** This aggregates your total assets and liabilities based on the categories you defined, giving you a structured summary of your net worth.

## 3. Advanced Portfolio Application

The Group feature offers maximum flexibility within the **Portfolio Page**.

### Default Groups
By default, your portfolios use the groups you assigned in the Account Details (as described in Section 1).

### Independent Customization (Context-Specific)
This is a powerful advanced feature in Synx. If you create multiple custom portfolios (e.g., one for "Risk Analysis" and another for "Sector Analysis"), you can define **different groups for the same asset** in each portfolio.

**What this means:**
You can classify the same asset (e.g., TSMC stock) as **"Semiconductor"** in Portfolio A, and as **"Core Holding"** in Portfolio B.

These settings do not conflict. This provides immense flexibility, allowing you to analyze the same set of assets from multiple dimensions without messing up your original records.
