Managing repetitive cash flow—whether it's paying rent or Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into stocks—is seamless in Synx. While they apply to different account types, the logic is the same: you control the frequency and the level of automation.

## 1. Setting Frequency

When adding a transaction, toggle the **"Recurring"** option to unlock flexible scheduling:

* **Frequency:** Yearly, Quarterly, Monthly, or Weekly.
* **Specific Day:** e.g., "Every Wednesday" or "The 5th of every month."

## 2. Auto-Record vs. Manual Confirmation

This is the core of Synx’s cash flow management. You decide whether the app records the transaction automatically or asks for your confirmation first:

### Fixed Cash Flow (Auto-Record ON)
* **Best For:** Fixed amounts (e.g., Rent, Salaries, Netflix subscriptions).
* **How it works:** Enable "Auto-Record." When the date arrives, Synx records the transaction in the background. Zero effort required.

### Variable Cash Flow (Auto-Record OFF)
* **Best For:** Fluctuating amounts (e.g., Utility bills, Credit card payments).
* **How it works:** Set the frequency but keep "Auto-Record" **OFF**. When the date arrives, the transaction appears in your "Pending" list, reminding you to enter the actual amount.

⚠️ **Note on Investments:** For recurring investments (DCA), since stock prices change every time, Synx disables Auto-Record by default to ensure your cost basis remains accurate.

## 3. Skip Weekends

If your payment date (e.g., a bank transfer or stock purchase) falls on a weekend, Synx offers a smart solution:

* **Enable "Skip Weekend":** The system will automatically shift the transaction date to the **next business day**.
* **Benefit:** This ensures your record dates match actual bank deduction dates, keeping your ledger precise.

## 4. Workflow: From "Upcoming" to "Done"

Synx uses a timeline approach to help you manage future payments and DCA orders efficiently without cluttering your current balance.

### Step 1: Upcoming (Forecasting)
Any future recurring transaction appears in the **"Upcoming"** list. This gives you a clear preview of your future cash needs or investment schedules before they happen.

### Step 2: Pending & Smart Pre-fill (Action Time)
On the scheduled date (if Auto-Record is off), the transaction moves to the **"Pending"** list. This is where Synx shines, especially for investments:

* **For Bills:** Tap to enter the final bill amount and confirm.
* **For Investments (DCA):** When you tap a pending stock purchase, Synx activates **Smart Pre-fill**. It automatically pulls that day's market price. You simply review the shares and price, then tap "Confirm."

This workflow solves the pain point of manual entry, giving you perfect investment records with just one tap.
