**1. Interactive Visualizations**
Visualize your financial journey with interactive line charts. Switch between different time ranges and asset categories to clearly see your net worth growth, asset allocation ratios, and overall financial direction.

**2. Automated Transaction Management**
Synx handles fixed and variable transactions differently for maximum efficiency. Fixed expenses are tracked automatically, while variable investments (like DCA) are pre-filled based on market data for your one-tap confirmation. This ensures your cost basis is always accurate without the hassle.

**3. Real-Time Price Sync**
Your investment assets—including stocks (US, TW, UK, JP, CN, HK), cryptocurrencies, and precious metals—automatically update with global market prices. There is no need to manually look up and enter daily prices anymore, ensuring your portfolio value is always current.

**4. Investment Performance Dashboard**
Get a clear snapshot of your portfolio. The dashboard displays your cost basis, unrealized and realized P&L, and market value trends, helping you understand the performance of every single holding at a glance.

**5. Global Market & Multi-Currency Support**
We currently support a wide range of markets including US, Taiwan, China, UK, Japan, and Hong Kong stocks, as well as Cryptocurrencies and Precious Metals. Synx also supports most major global currencies and automatically handles exchange rates, allowing you to view your total wealth in your preferred base currency seamlessly.

**6. Privacy-First Architecture**
Your financial data is never uploaded to our servers as we only connect to the internet to sync public market prices. Unlike other aggregators, Synx does not ask for your bank or brokerage account passwords, ensuring you maintain full control over your privacy and security.

**7. Secure Backup & Restore**
Seamlessly backup and restore your data via your personal iCloud account, ensuring your data stays with you even if you switch devices. We also support exporting manual backup files, giving you an extra layer of data safety and portability.
