At Synx, we understand the extreme sensitivity of financial data. That's why we adopted a **Privacy-First** architecture, ensuring your information belongs to you and you alone.

## 1. Data Storage Mechanism

**Absolute Privacy**
All financial data (including asset balances, transaction history, and memos) is stored strictly on your **local device**.

**Zero Uploads**
Synx never uploads your personal financial records to any cloud server. Neither the developer nor any third party can access your data.

**Server Role**
Our servers are used solely to sync **public market data** (exchange rates and stock prices). They never touch or process your private ledger.

## 2. Biometric Protection

To prevent unauthorized access to your app, Synx supports system-level biometric security:

**Face ID / Touch ID**
Once enabled, authentication via Face ID or Touch ID is required every time you open the app.

**How to Setup**
Go to **Settings** > Enable **Biometric Lock**.

## 3. Privacy Mode

When checking your assets in public spaces (like on the subway or at the office), you might worry about prying eyes.

**Function**
Instantly hide all sensitive figures (displayed as **** ) with one tap.

**How to Use**
You can quickly toggle this mode by tapping the **"Eye Icon"** on the Insight Page

## 4. Secure iCloud Backup

To prevent data loss or to facilitate switching phones, you can enable the iCloud Backup feature.

**Encrypted Transfer**
Your backup files are encrypted and transferred directly to your **personal iCloud storage**.

**No Access Policy**
Synx only provides the pipeline for the backup. We **cannot decrypt or access** the backup files stored in your iCloud.
