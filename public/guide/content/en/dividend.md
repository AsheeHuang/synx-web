Because Synx prioritizes privacy and simplicity, we do not automatically track complex corporate actions like stock splits or dividend schedules. If your holdings undergo a "Stock Split" or "Dividend Payout," please use the following manual methods to keep your portfolio accurate.

## 1. Stock Splits or Stock Dividends

When you receive additional shares for free (e.g., a 1-for-4 split, or a stock dividend), the goal is to **increase your share count** without **increasing your total cost**.

**The Logic: Add a "Buy" transaction, but set the Cost to 0.**

### Example: Simulating a "1-for-4 Split"

Suppose you originally held 1 share. After the split, you should possess 4 shares (an increase of 3 shares).

**Action:** Add a new **Buy** transaction.
* **Shares:** Enter **3** (the number of new shares received).
* **Cost:** Enter **0**.

**Result:** Your total holdings increase to 4 shares, while your total cost remains unchanged. Consequently, your **average cost per share** will automatically decrease to reflect the split correctly.

## 2. Cash Dividends

When you receive cash dividends, it is treated as actual cash income.

**The Logic: Add an "Income" transaction.**

### Steps

1.  Tap **"+"** and select **"Add Transaction"**.
2.  Select the **Account that actually received the funds** (e.g., your Bank Settlement Account or Cash Account).
    * ⚠️ **Note:** Do not select the Investment Account (the stock symbol itself) unless you are manually tracking a cash balance within that specific brokerage account.
3.  Enter the dividend **Amount**.
4.  Set the Category to **"Dividend"** or "Investment Income" (you can add a memo for details).

**Result:** Your bank account balance increases, accurately reflecting the realized cash flow from your investments.
