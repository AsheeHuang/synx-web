Tapping the "+" button in the bottom right corner starts the "Add Account" process. To ensure your net worth is calculated accurately, Synx categorizes accounts into three main types. Please choose the one that fits the nature of your asset:

## 1. Select Account Type

* **Assets:**
    Suitable for items that do not require market price synchronization.
    * *Examples:* Cash, Bank Deposits, Real Estate, Prepaid Card Balances.

* **Investments:**
    Suitable for items with prices that fluctuate with the market. Synx will track their real-time market value for you.
    * *Examples:* Stocks, Cryptocurrencies, Precious Metals.

* **Liabilities:**
    Suitable for negative assets, meaning debts you need to repay.
    * *Examples:* Personal Loans, Mortgages, Car Loans, Credit Card Debt.

## 2. Set Account Details

After selecting the type, please fill in the following information:

* **Group & Name:**
    * You can create custom groups (e.g., Living Expenses, Retirement) to organize your accounts.
    * **Tip:** If you select an **Investment** account, the account name will default to the asset name automatically (e.g., enter "TSLA", and the name automatically sets to "Tesla"), saving you typing time.
    * *Note:* Groups and Names can be edited at any time after creation.

* **Initial Status:**
    * **Initial Balance:** Enter the current amount in this account.
    * **Start Date:** Set the date to start tracking. This determines when this account's balance begins to appear on your Net Worth chart.
    * **Memo:** Record account numbers or other reminders here.

Once you have filled in the details, tap **Save** in the bottom right corner, and your account is successfully created!
