      },
      content: {
        p1: "I've always been someone who loves data. Even if the data isn't useful, I still like to keep it — just because. Like how I track the temperature in my room every day. I don't really need that information, but I just enjoy seeing the numbers go up and down.",
        p2: "It's the same with financial data. I like watching my assets change, the movement of that line going up and down. Maybe it doesn't mean much to anyone else, but for me, it represents a kind of measurable growth.",
        p3: "When I started looking for asset management apps, I ran into two main problems. The first one is that most apps that can sync with the stock market only do that — they can't include other types of assets like real estate, cash, or bank accounts. I wanted a single place where I could see everything together and understand the bigger picture.",
        p4: "The second issue is that I invest regularly through DCA. I noticed that these apps couldn't record each contribution in real time. Sometimes I forgot to enter it, sometimes I had to type it in manually, and there were no reminders. The data just wasn't accurate or up to date, and that made tracking my cash flow difficult.",
        p5: "I've tried a lot of different apps. Some are too automatic — they ask for your bank credentials so they can sync everything. That never felt secure to me, and often ran into limits with bank or legal restrictions. Some banks don't even support syncing at all, which leaves your data incomplete. Others are too manual — you have to enter every little expense yourself. Tracking things like dinner or coffee every day felt exhausting. I didn't want to be tied to bookkeeping.",
        p6: "So with Synx, I wanted to find the middle ground — something semi-automatic. Your stocks and investments could sync automatically and stay organized, but your cash flow and recurring payments could stay under your own control, with reminders when needed.",
        p7: "I don't care about recording every small expense. I just want to focus on the big picture — the major inflows and outflows — and see the overall direction of my finances.",
        p8: "That's why I want Synx to be a simple and practical tool. It doesn't need to be flashy or overloaded with features. It should help organize my data without getting in my way. Some parts should be automatic, and others I can control myself. I just want a clear view of how everything changes.",
        p9: "I've always been the kind of person who likes solving problems. As a software engineer, I usually start with my own needs, and this time, I wanted to solve more than just my own.",
        p10: "I think Synx fills that missing space in asset management — something simple yet complete, clean and reliable, without unnecessary complexity or linking accounts.",
        p11: "So I figured, if it doesn't exist, I'll just build it myself.",
        p12: "I made this app purely to solve my own problems, and I'm really happy that those problems are finally solved. I hope Synx can help solve yours too. If there's a feature you'd like to see, feel free to reach out — it might be something I need as well.",

        p1: "我一直都是個喜歡看資料的人。即使那些資料沒有實際用途，我還是會想把它們留下來，就像我會記錄房間每天的溫度變化，雖然不一定會用到那些數據，但我就是單純喜歡看著它們上上下下。",
        p2: "對我來說，財務的數據也一樣。我喜歡看著資產的變化、那條折線的起伏，也許對別人來說這沒有什麼實際意義，但對我而言，那是一種可被量化的成長感。",
        p3: "在找資產管理 App 的時候，我發現了兩個痛點。第一個是，大部分能同步股票的 App 通常就只能同步股票，沒辦法同時記錄其他類型的資產，像房地產、現金或銀行帳戶。但我希望能把所有資產都放在同一個地方，清楚看到整體的變化。",
        p4: "第二個痛點是我有定期定額的習慣。我發現這類 App 沒辦法即時記錄每一次的金額，有時會忘記，有時又要手動輸入，也沒有提醒。資料因此變得不即時，也讓我沒辦法完整地追蹤金流。",
        p5: "我試過很多資產管理 App。有些太自動，要你交出銀行帳號密碼讓系統幫你同步，但那樣讓人覺得不安心，也常受到法規或銀行限制，甚至有些銀行根本不開放同步，資料就不完整。也有一些 App 太手動，每筆開銷都得自己輸入，連吃飯或買咖啡都要記下來，對我來說那太繁瑣，我不想被記帳綁住。",
        p6: "我希望 Synx 能找到中間的平衡，一個「半自動」的系統。股票和投資資產可以自動同步、幫我整理，但現金流和定期定額的紀錄，我能自己掌控時間和金額，系統只要在該提醒的時候提醒我就好。",
        p7: "我不追求記下所有小額消費，只想專注在主要的支出與收入，看到財務的整體方向和趨勢。",
        p8: "所以我希望 Synx 是一個簡單又實用的工具，不需要太花俏，也不需要太多功能。它應該能幫我整理資料，但不要干擾我，該自動的地方自動，該手動的地方我能自己控制，只要讓我能清楚看到一切的變化就夠了。",
        p9: "我本來就是個喜歡解決問題的人。身為軟體工程師，我總是從自己的需求開始動手，而這一次，我想解決的不只是自己的問題。",
        p10: "我希望 Synx 能補上市場上那個「簡單但完整的資產管理」的空缺，不需要雜亂的操作，也不需要連線帳號，只要乾淨、明確、可靠。",
        p11: "所以我想，既然沒有這樣的產品，那就自己來做一個。",
        p12: "我做這個 App，完全是為了解決自己的問題，而我很開心這些問題真的被解決了。希望 Synx 也能幫你解決你的問題。如果你有想加入的功能，歡迎隨時聯繫我，或許那也是我需要的功能。",
