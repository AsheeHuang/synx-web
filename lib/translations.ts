        subtitle: "A behind-the-scenes look at how Synx was designed, built, and refined — from first concept to daily companion.",
      },
      content: {
        p1: "I've always been someone who loves looking at data. Even when the data has no practical use, I still want to keep it. Like how I record the daily temperature changes in my room — I never actually use those numbers, but I simply enjoy watching them go up and down.",
        p2: "For me, financial data is the same. I like watching asset changes, the ups and downs of that line chart. Maybe it has no real meaning to others, but to me, it's a kind of \"quantifiable sense of growth.\"",
        p3: "When looking for asset management apps, I discovered two pain points.",
        p4: "The first is that most apps that can \"sync stocks\" can only do that one thing. They can't simultaneously track other types of assets — like real estate, cash, or bank accounts. But I wanted all my assets in one place, to see the overall picture.",
        p5: "The second is that I have a habit of regular fixed investments. I often found these apps couldn't record each amount in real-time. Sometimes I'd forget, sometimes I'd have to input manually, and there were no reminders. This made the data lose its \"real-time nature\" and prevented me from fully tracking my cash flow.",
        p6: "I tried many different asset management apps. Some were too automatic, requiring me to hand over my bank account credentials for the system to sync data. But that approach made me uneasy, and it was often limited by regulations or bank restrictions. Some banks simply didn't allow syncing, leading to incomplete data.",
        p7: "Other apps were too manual. Every expense had to be entered manually — recording dinner, coffee, or transportation costs daily. For me, this was too tedious. I didn't want to be bound by expense tracking.",
        p8: "I wanted Synx to find the middle ground — a \"semi-automatic\" system.",
        p9: "Stocks and investment assets can sync and organize automatically; but for cash flow and regular fixed investments, I can control the timing and amounts myself, with the system just reminding me when needed.",
        p10: "I don't seek to record every small purchase. I just want to focus on major expenses and income, to see the overall direction and trends of my finances.",
        p11: "So I wanted Synx to be a simple yet practical tool. Not too flashy, not too many features. I wanted it to help me organize data without interfering. Automatic where it should be automatic, manual where I want control. Just let me clearly see how everything changes.",
        p12: "I've always been someone who likes solving problems. As a software engineer, I always start from my own needs. And this time, I wanted to solve not just my problem.",
        p13: "I hoped Synx could fill that gap in the market for \"simple but complete asset management.\" No clutter, no account linking required — just clean, clear, and reliable.",
        p14: "So I thought — if there's no product like this, then I'll just make one myself.",
        p15: "I built this app entirely to solve my own problems. And I'm happy to say — those problems were truly solved.",
        p16: "I hope Synx can help you solve your problems too. If you have features you'd like to see added, feel free to reach out anytime. Maybe it's something I need as well.",
      },
      designPhilosophy: {
        title: "Design Philosophy",
        p1: "From the start, we committed to a design philosophy centered on clarity, simplicity, and delight. Financial applications don't have to be intimidating or cluttered with charts and jargon. We drew inspiration from modern note-taking apps and design systems that prioritize white space and readability.",
        p2: "Every screen in Synx follows a clear visual hierarchy. The signature accent color — a vibrant cyan (#06D6D6) — was chosen to convey trust, energy, and forward momentum. It's a color that feels modern yet approachable, standing out in a sea of blue banking apps.",
        p3: "We obsessed over micro-interactions and animations. Transitions feel smooth and intentional. Every tap, swipe, and scroll is designed to provide instant feedback, making the app feel responsive and alive.",
        p4: "Typography plays a crucial role in our design language. We selected typefaces that are easy to read at any size, ensuring that numbers, labels, and insights remain crisp and legible whether you're glancing at your phone or reviewing detailed reports.",
      },
      buildingTheCore: {
        title: "Building the Core",
        p1: "The technical foundation of Synx is built on modern web technologies and native mobile frameworks. We chose React Native for the mobile app to ensure a consistent experience across iOS and Android, while maintaining the flexibility to optimize for each platform's unique characteristics.",
        p2: "Data synchronization happens seamlessly in the background using encrypted APIs and real-time updates. We implemented a robust offline-first architecture, meaning you can access your wealth data even without an internet connection. Once you're back online, everything syncs automatically.",
        p3: "Performance was non-negotiable. We optimized every database query, compressed assets, and minimized bundle sizes to ensure the app loads quickly and responds instantly. Lazy loading and code splitting keep the initial experience lightweight while still providing rich functionality.",
        p4: "Security is embedded at every layer. From end-to-end encryption to secure token storage, we followed industry best practices and went through multiple security audits to ensure user data remains protected.",
      },
      visualizingWealth: {
        title: "Visualizing Wealth",
        p1: "One of Synx's most distinctive features is how it visualizes financial data. We rejected the idea of overwhelming users with complex charts and tables. Instead, we focused on clear, actionable insights presented through intuitive visualizations.",
        p2: "The dashboard provides an at-a-glance overview with subtle animations that guide your eye to what matters most. Charts are interactive but never distracting. Color-coding helps differentiate asset classes, while trend lines and percentage changes give context without requiring mental math.",
        p3: "We also introduced intelligent summaries powered by data analysis. Rather than just showing numbers, Synx highlights patterns, suggests optimizations, and surfaces insights that help users make informed decisions about their financial future.",
        p4: "Accessibility was a priority. All visualizations include text alternatives, and the interface supports screen readers and adjustable font sizes to ensure everyone can use Synx effectively.",
      },
      privacyByDesign: {
        title: "Privacy by Design",
        p1: "Privacy isn't an afterthought at Synx — it's a founding principle. We believe that your financial data belongs to you and you alone. That's why we built the app with privacy-first architecture from day one.",
        p2: "All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols. We don't sell your data to third parties, and we don't use it for advertising. Your information is stored securely on servers that comply with international data protection regulations.",
        p3: "Transparency is key. Our privacy policy is written in plain language, and we're upfront about exactly what data we collect, how we use it, and how you can request deletion. You maintain full control over your account and data at all times.",
        p4: "We also support biometric authentication and multi-factor authentication to add extra layers of security. Your peace of mind is just as important as the app's functionality.",
      },
      whatsNext: {
        title: "What's Next",
        p1: "Synx is constantly evolving. We're working on new features based on user feedback, including enhanced budgeting tools, automated savings recommendations, and deeper integrations with financial institutions around the world.",
        p2: "We're also exploring AI-powered insights that can help predict market trends, suggest portfolio rebalancing, and provide personalized financial advice tailored to your goals and risk tolerance.",
        p3: "Our vision is to make Synx the most trusted and comprehensive wealth management companion available. Whether you're just starting to build wealth or managing a complex portfolio, Synx will adapt to your needs and grow with you over time.",
        p4: "Thank you for being part of this journey. We're excited to continue building Synx with your feedback and support. If you have ideas, questions, or just want to say hello, we'd love to hear from you.",

      content: {
        p1: "我一直都是個喜歡看資料的人。即使那些資料沒有實際用途，我仍然會想把它們留下來。就像我會記錄我房間每天的溫度變化，雖然我不會真的用到那些數據，但我就是單純喜歡看著它們上上下下。",
        p2: "對我來說，財務的數據也一樣。我喜歡看著資產的變化、那條折線的起伏。也許對別人來說這沒有什麼實際意義，但對我而言，那是一種「可被量化的成長感」。",
        p3: "在找資產管理 App 的時候，我發現了兩個痛點。",
        p4: "第一個，是大部分能「同步股票」的 App，只能做這件事。它們沒辦法同時記錄其他類型的資產——像是房地產、現金、銀行帳戶。但我希望我的所有資產都能放在同一個地方，看見整體變化。",
        p5: "第二個，是我自己有定期定額的習慣。我常常發現這類 App 沒辦法即時記錄每一次的金額。有時會忘記、有時要手動輸入、也沒有提醒。這樣資料就失去了「即時性」，也讓我無法完整地追蹤我的金流。",
        p6: "我嘗試過很多不同的資產管理 App。有些太自動，需要把銀行帳號密碼交出去，讓系統去同步資料。但那樣的方式讓我覺得不安心，也常受到法規或銀行限制。有些銀行甚至根本不開放同步，導致資料不完整。",
        p7: "另外一些 App 又太手動。每筆開銷都要自己輸入，每天記錄晚餐、咖啡或交通費。對我來說，這太繁瑣了，我不想被記帳綁住。",
        p8: "我希望 Synx 能找到中間的平衡點——一個「半自動」的系統。",
        p9: "股票與投資資產可以自動同步、幫我整理；但現金流和定期定額的紀錄，我可以自己掌控時間與金額，系統只要適時地提醒我就好。",
        p10: "我不追求記下所有小額消費，我只想專注在大筆的支出與收入，看見財務的整體方向與趨勢。",
        p11: "所以我希望 Synx 是一個簡單又實用的工具。不要太花俏，也不要太多功能。我希望它能幫我整理資料，但不去干擾我。該自動的地方自動，該手動的地方我能自己控制。就只是讓我能清楚看到所有東西的變化。",
        p12: "我本來就是個喜歡解決問題的人。身為軟體工程師，我總是從自己的需求開始動手。而這一次，我想解決的不只是我的問題。",
        p13: "我希望 Synx 能補上市場上那個「簡單但完整的資產管理」空缺。不需要雜亂、不需要連線帳號，只要乾淨、明確、可靠。",
        p14: "所以我就想——既然沒有這樣的產品，那就自己來做一個吧。",
        p15: "我做這個 App，完全是為了解決我自己的問題。而我很開心，這些問題真的被解決了。",

        p2: "Synx 的每個畫面都遵循清晰的視覺層次。我們選擇了充滿活力的青色（#06D6D6）作為標誌性的強調色，旨在傳達信任、活力和前進的動力。這是一種現代而平易近人的顏色，在一片藍色銀行應用中脫穎而出。",
        p3: "我們痴迷於微互動和動畫。轉場流暢而有意義。每次點擊、滑動和滾動都經過精心設計，提供即時回饋，讓應用程式感覺靈敏而生動。",
